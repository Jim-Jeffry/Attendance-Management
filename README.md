# Attendance Management System

## Project Overview:
The **Attendance Management System** is a Java-based application that allows students to mark their attendance both when entering and leaving. It tracks attendance times and displays present/absent students. This system uses basic Java concepts, and stores attendance data in a simple in-memory structure.

## Features:
- Students can mark their attendance for "In" and "Out".
- The system tracks the attendance time.
- Staff members can check the attendance register.
- View the number of students present/absent.

## Technologies Used:
- **Java** (Core Java)
- **Collections** (ArrayLists, HashMaps)

## How to Use:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run `Attendance.java` class.
3. Interact with the system by following the prompts for marking attendance.

## Setup:
- Ensure that Java is installed on your system (Java 8 or above).
- Clone the repository:
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/Jim-Jeffry/Attendace-Management
